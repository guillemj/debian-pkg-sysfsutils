Description: sysfs query tool and boot-time setup
 The sysfs is a virtual file system found in Linux kernels 2.5+ that provides
 a tree of system devices. This package provides the program 'systool' to
 query it, which can be used to list devices by bus, class, and topology.
 .
 In addition this package ships a configuration file /etc/sysfs.conf which
 allows one to conveniently set sysfs attributes at system bootup (via an
 init script).
